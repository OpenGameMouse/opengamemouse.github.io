  The goal of Open Game Mouse is to design a high-performance mouse platform 
  that can be used directly in production or can be easily customized by users. 
  Break through the limitations of the current mouse. 
  For example, we will allow multiple wireless dongles and stronger key programming. 
  Users can develop various creative uses on this open mouse. 
  Everyone is welcome to join in development.
